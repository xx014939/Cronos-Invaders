## Product & Use Cases

Cronos Invaders is a play to earn, Web3 based multiplayer space invaders game created for the
Moralis & Cronos 2022 Gaming Hackathon. Cronos Invaders combines classic and nostalgic
space invaders themed gameplay, alongside NFT based stat upgrades, multiplayer
tournaments, and play to earn features which are designed to keep users coming back.
The base offering of Cronos Invaders is a typical space invaders game, with an infinite amount
of levels. Users can compete against themselves to advance through more difficult enemy AI’s
and reach higher and higher scores.

Each run of the base game will produce a random set of conditions, which when met will allow
users to mint a “Cronos Invader NFT”, that results in a stat upgrade for their spaceship. For the
purpose of demoing, we have hard coded a threshold of 500 or more points in order to unlock
the minting feature, however in production this will make use of our existing coin flip probability
logic with additional layers implemented.

If a user chooses to mint an NFT, they will get a random stat upgrade which is automatically
applied for their spaceship. For example, a users base speed is currently 5 points, upon
initiating an NFT roll they will be offered the opportunity to mint an NFT with 1-3 speed points. If
they choose to mint this NFT, the stats will be added to their spaceship and they can return to
the base game and make use of their new upgrade.
Users are enticed to do well in the single player mode, because once every month the top 16
players will be invited to 16 man tournament in order to compete for a portion of the proceeds
from all minted NFT’s.

Currently fifty percent of all mint proceeds being held in our NFT smart contracts, are paid
directly to our tournament contract. Upon winning the monthly tournament, a user is granted one
week to withdraw the funds (in Cronos) directly to their wallet.

This ecosystem has several benefits including
1. Self sustaining - We never have to put Cronos up front into tournaments, as they are
completely funded by player participation. In other words, the ecosystem funds itself.

2. A small player base is no issue - Due to the structure of this ecosystem, even a relatively
small player base can still be sufficiently enticed to participate in NFT minting and
monthly tournaments. At an active player base of 50 users, even if each user only
minted a single NFT in a given month the top 16 players would have the opportunity to
win back 25x their original investment.

3. Cronos Invaders isn’t “Play to Win” - Through constant randomisation, it becomes
equally as hard for all players to advance their spaceships and achieve a high level of
overall stats. Skill plays a huge part in being able to advance through levels, and it’s
entirely possible that a user with an inferior stat sheet can still place higher than a user
with a superior stat sheet.

## Go to Market Strategy

Web3/Metaverse style games and apps are on the rise, and whilst mass adoption has still not
been achieved in every category, “Play2Earn'' mobile games have seen significant adoption
recently and continue to grow [1]. These applications generally speaking have some type of
crypto/tokenization integration, and we feel that Cronos Invaders is well placed to become a
contender in this market space.

The first part of our go to market strategy will rely heavily on building upon our initial prototype
and porting it over to both IOS and Android. This should be relatively simple, and won’t require
significant development work to the nature of our current codebase.

Upon completion of our game, we will enter into a Beta testing phase where the game is offered
in “Early Access” to users who wish to participate in the Cronos Invaders ecosystem. Traditional
marketing pathways for new applications such as Product Hunt will be utilized, alongside Crypto
based marketing efforts on CT, Reddit and Discord.

This will begin an iterable process of product feedback and improvement, in which we hear from
current users, take their feedback on board, and improve the application to exceed user
expectation. This will allow us to build a strong foundation, with a community of players who
participate regularly in our events and game modes.

The resulting revenue from this player base will be used for further product enhancement
alongside paid marketing, resulting in an even greater player base and thus increased revenue.
As a consequence of a large and active player base, we will be in a position to create
partnerships with other brands inside of the Web3 space. Offering one off spaceship NFT’s with
specific branding/logos, alongside other tokenized digital assets in partnership with these
companies, which will in turn further boost revenue and adoption rates.
